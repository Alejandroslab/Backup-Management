First! Rememeber that there is not possibility to 'undo' a RAID array.
Once you setup one you stick with that.

You can only expand the RAID but not delete volumes or disks from it and shrink it.
(anyways you can eject broken disk inside RAID and then make the NAS rebuild the RAID)

REMEMBER: YOU CAN NEVER REMOVE DISKS FROM A RAID!

if you have 4 drives and want 3 drives inside the RAID array you will have
to rebuild the NAS from scratch

WARNING: Before making any changes with RAID (even before adding new volumes as extension
or adding a new storage pool)
always remember to do a FULL BACKUP!
