First! Rememeber that there is not possibility to 'undo' a RAID array.
Once you setup one you stick with that.

You can only expand the RAID but not delete volumes or disks from it and shrink it.
(anyways you can eject broken disk inside RAID and then make the NAS rebuild the RAID)

REMEMBER: YOU CAN NEVER REMOVE DISKS FROM A RAID!

if you have 4 drives and want 3 drives inside the RAID array you will have
to rebuild the NAS from scratch

To rebuild from scratch:
turn off the NAS, eject the disks, turn on then follow setup and plug the disks



---

WARNING: Before making any changes with RAID (even before adding new volumes as extension
or adding a new storage pool)
always remember to do a FULL BACKUP!
------
ANOTHER things

if you want to use different size drives rememeber that RAID will use the smallest
therefore if you have 3 drives like:

2tb   2tb   4tb

then you will know that RAID will user

2tb   2tb   2tb

therefore 2tb will be 'lost', not in the sense that you have lost data but in
the sense that wou will not be able to use the extra space.
