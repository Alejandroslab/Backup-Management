If you use windows backup and you want to create the backup (the old Windows 7 system) onto a network folder

It may happen that Control Panel will give error

To make it work try to change the case of the serverhostname when you type it in the bar:

like:

\\mylocalserver

to 

\\MYLOCALSERVER

or try to use the ip 

or again try to use a different folder

Then it will work (eventually)
