Before uploading your stuff to a cloud service (any of them)
encrypt your data!

in mac just open Disk Utility
then click on File-> New Image ->Image from folder

select your folder then select encryption SHA256-bit
input a strong password
select the folder in which to save your encrypted folder

done!

remember that the folder will be zipped in an encrypted container
this means that you cannot access directly to your files
but you have to unencrypt the container and then extract the
folder with your files like any .zip file

alternatively (also in Windows) you can use
Veracrypt

(but sometimes it is much slower)
