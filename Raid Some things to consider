When you physically add a drive you have to go into the management GUI to tell the NAS what to do with the drive.
You decide not he NAS.


If you already added it to the existing raid then there is nothing you can do.
You cannot shrink a raid.

The only why to get the drive back is to rebuild the NAS from scratch.
